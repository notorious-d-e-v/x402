"@x402/core": patch
---

Fixed `@x402/paywall` auto-detection. Browser 402 responses served the static fallback page even when `@x402/paywall` was installed, because core called a `getPaywallHtml` export that v2 removed (and used `require`, which ESM builds don't have). Core now imports `@x402/paywall` at request time when no paywall provider is registered and renders it with the EVM, Solana and Algorand handlers.
